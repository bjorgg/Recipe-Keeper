# Module 6 - React Framework

In this school assignment I was supposed to study a React framework, how to connect a database and/or a CMS to my app application and how to deploy a web application to a professional deployment platform. I chose to use Next.js, Prismic and Vercel.

## Recipe Keeper

My idea was to build a recipe keeper application, a place where one can keep all of "theirs" recipes. For now their are just four recipes in there. The application is very minimal, a front page which lists all recipes and then you can click on each to navigate to the recipe. The logo links back to the front page. It's also very simply styled. This is a project which I hope I will come back to and add more features to it. Also to add more recipes so I can maybe someday get empty the drawer which is full of recipes I have printed out, cut out from some paper/magazine or jotted down on a piece of paper.

## Future vision

- Search - be able to search for a recipe by name or keyword.
- Log in - since the site is thought for personal use it would be nice to have a log in feature.
- Filter by tags - be able to filter recipes by tags which each recipe currently has.
- Favorites - be able to mark you favorite recipes and then filter by favorites.
